For each mesh (body, clothes, hair):

Manual Option (for validation):
Select object.

In Object Mode:

Object > Apply > Visual Geometry to Mesh
Or press: F3 → search for Convert To > Mesh.

This ensures what you see in the viewport becomes the actual exported mesh.

🧠 You must not skip this. Otherwise, .glb sees the object in rest pose or ignores the deformations from armatures or modifiers.

✅ 2. Remove Armature/Parenting
Still in Object Mode:

For each object:

Object > Parent > Clear and Keep Transformation
Or press Alt + P and choose “Clear and Keep Transformation”.

This unlinks the mesh from the rig but keeps the posed shape.

✅ 3. Unwrap UVs (if not done yet)
If you haven't yet, select each object one-by-one:

Go to Edit Mode → select all → U → Smart UV Project.

Then: UV > Pack Islands in UV Editor.

Each object will now use the same UV layout space with non-overlapping UV islands.

✅ 4. Export .glb – With Final, Baked Objects
Now that everything is:

✅ In the final pose,

✅ Clean of modifiers or rig links,

✅ UV-unified and static...
